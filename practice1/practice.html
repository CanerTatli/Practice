    <h1>Let It Happen</h1>
    <h4>Song by Tame Impala</h4>

      It's always around me, all this noise
      But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
      Let it happen, let it happen (it's gonna feel so good)
      Just let it happen, let it happen
      
      All this running around
      Trying to cover my shadow
      A notion growing inside
      Now all the others seem shallow
      All this running around
      Bearing down on my shoulders
      I can hear an alarm
      Must be morning
      
      I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
      It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound and
      When it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
      So let it happen, let it happen
      
      All this running around
      I can't fight it much longer
      Something's trying to get out
      And it's never been closer
      If my take-off fails
      Make up some other story
      But if I never come back
      Tell my lover I'm sorry
      
      I cuh-nuh duh-wuh, you wuh-nuh scri-wih
      Try-guh-duh do-wee, try to pun-stoo-wee
      You wuh-nuh thinkin' that I wuh-luh do-wee
      They be lovin' someone and I wuh-nuh stuh-wee
      Take the next ticket to take the next train
      Why would I do-wee, eh you wuh tun-tun na
      
      I cuh-nuh duh-wuh, you wuh-nuh scri-wih
      Try-guh-duh do-wee, try to pun-stoo-wee
      You wuh-nuh thinkin' that I wuh-nuh do-wee
      They be lovin' someone and I wuh-luh stuh-wee (baby, now I'm ready, moving on)
      Take the next ticket to take the next train (oh, but maybe I was ready all along)
      Why would I do-wee, eh you wuh tun-tun na (oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound)
      
      I cuh-nuh duh-wuh, you wuh-nuh scri-wih (oh, but maybe I was ready all along)
      Try-guh-duh do-wee, try to pun-stoo-wee (oh, baby, now I'm ready, moving on)
      You wuh-nuh thinkin' that I wuh-luh do-wee (oh, but maybe I was ready all along)
      They be lovin' someone and I wuh-nuh stuh-wee (oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound)
      Take the next ticket to take the next train (oh, but maybe I was ready all along)
      (Oh, baby)
